Hey guys, this is Mateo Johnson\! I’m your Engineering Project Manager this year, and these are some basic Metrobots guidelines for the 24-25 season\! You absolutely don’t have to read all of these, but I’d love it if you could skim over, or look at parts that pertain to you. These all come from my personal experience/notes, so if you have any questions/clarifications, feel free to reach out to me on slack @Mateo Johnson, or by email at johnson.12@themetroschool.org

### **Design Commandments**

* NO CENTER PIVOT ARMS (EVER). THIS INCLUDES “BACK” PIVOTS.  
* Always favor designs with the smallest amount of movement above the drivetrain (things that can get hit) and keep designs short and sturdy.  
* Simpler is always better, unless simplicity comes at the cost of consistency   
* Design reviews are great, but we want a finished practice bot by week 3 (finalized designs by end of week 1\) (Drivetrain built by week 0\)  
* Prioritize building the robot, but not at the expense of quality or teaching rookies. (Have rookies work on smaller projects/subsystems)  
* Driver practice during the offseason (always pleaseeeeee)  
* Don’t be scared by things that seem like coding challenges (multi stage extensions, or things with limited movement)  
* Find limelight mounting places before we get to fabricating  
* Finish auto before comps (pleaseeeeee)  
* Don’t be afraid to break it while testing (Your opponents won’t be)  
* Full width & UTB (Under The Bumper) intakes if possible

### **Design Process**

* CAD early and CAD well. If you do not have CAD or some other comprehensive design model at your design review, then we will not be using your design.  
* Iterate, and don’t get too attached to any one design. Be critical but fair and unbiased.  
* Part orders should be in by week four. We will not order any parts after week 4\.  
* Belts are preferable to chains if you don’t need to lift weight.  
* Large gears instead of chain preferably.  
* Please do not blame things on programming if you put metal shavings in the RoboRIO.  
* For the subsystem managers, you need to create documentation for your prototype.

### **Schedule & Deadlines**

* **Week 0:** Have the drivetrain finished (Driver tryouts and practice).  
* **Week 1:** Have design tentatively finished, subsystems defined and assigned. Have the practice field started.  
* **Week 1 Sat:** Have initial design review and strategy meeting done.  
* **Week 2:** Prototyping done, design review Wednesday and Friday, robot concept finalized. Have the practice field fully built.  
* **Week 3:** Final drivetrain done (Programming week while superstructure is finished).  
* **Week 4:** Final robot assembled (Programming and Driver training).  
* **Week 5 & 6:** Driver Practice and fixing issues.  
* **OVER THE SUMMER:** GET PRACTICE DRIVETRAIN DONE (We did that).  
* **Week 1:** Prototype design concept finalized, strategy/priority list done, driver tryouts started.  
* **Week 2:** Physical prototype designs finalized, design reviews for full design.  
* **Week 3:** Drivetrain fully finished and ready for programming.  
* **Week 4:** Full robot assembled.

### **Meeting & Review Process**

* Design reviews are great, but we want a finished practice bot by week 3 (finalized designs by end of week 1).  
* Design reviews every Wednesday (short updates from subgroups, and assignments for the day).  
* Initial design review and strategy meeting done by the end of week 1\.  
* Schedule short and sweet starting meetings with just updates and assignments.  
* Don’t be afraid to break it while testing (Your opponents won’t be).

### **Practice & Training**

* Driver practice during the offseason (always pleaseeeeee).  
* Drivers need to have time logged in XRC, 3324-RobotSim, Rocket League, and on the actual robot. Drive Coaches also need to watch videos and do replay analysis (with their drivers or not).  
* Tentative Driver Practice Routine (instead of normal operations):  
  * **Monday:** RL games, XRC, 3324-RS.  
  * **Tuesday:** Match Analysis, 3324-RS.  
  * **Wednesday:** Hands on robot practice, Comms Practice.  
  * **Thursday:** RL games, XRC, 3324-RS.  
  * **Friday:** Off.  
  * **Saturday:** Off (RL Games and XRC recommended).

### **Programming**

* I will be there to help even if I’m EPM. I want Benny to program boards for all the prototypes, along with at least one subsystem.  
* Push for what you want, and advocate for yourself.  
* Lights on the robot pleaseeeeeeeee. These are so important for communicating states (intake positions & such).  
* Please get auto done early if possible.  
* We prefer configurable autos.  
* Your commit messages need to encapsulate every change that was made in every file during that commit.  
* I want someone to keep a Google Doc shared with all of programming.

### **Mechanical**

* Belts are preferable to chains if you don’t need to lift weight.  
* Large gears instead of chain preferably.  
* Please do not blame things on programming if you put metal shavings in the RoboRIO.  
* For the subsystem managers, you need to create documentation for your prototype.

### **Electrical**

* I would love it if some people in electrical would help with creating documentation for issues and fixes.

### **Strategy/Scouting/Driving**

* Anybody who wants to drive can drive as long as they show up consistently.  
* Drivers may drive in whatever orientation they prefer (Field or Robot).  
* Everything is in service to the alliance's goal (Winning the match, and getting RP).  
* Scouting. If you are at comps and you are on scouting rotations, you need to be at least observing, in whichever way works best for you (watching matches, using match-sim, talking to teams in the pits).

### **Design Tenets**

Just because tenets are not explicitly applied to your subgroup, doesn’t mean don’t try to apply them.

1. Consistency  
2. Strength  
3. Speed  
4. Simplicity  
5. Repair Time  
6. Ease of prototyping  
7. Assembly Time

### **Professionalism & Conduct**

* **Respect Everyone’s Time:** Be punctual for meetings, practices, and events.   
* **Maintain a Positive Attitude:** Approach every task, challenge, and interaction with a constructive mindset. Positivity creates a collaborative and supportive environment.  
* **Communicate Clearly and Constructively:** Ensure all communication is direct, respectful, and solution-oriented. Address conflicts or issues with empathy and focus on finding resolutions.  
* **Take Responsibility for Your Work:** Own your tasks and their outcomes, whether successful or in need of improvement. Be proactive in seeking feedback.  
* **Foster Team Collaboration:** Share knowledge and resources openly with team members.   
* **Adhere to Safety Protocols:** Always prioritize safety in every task. Follow established protocols and use protective gear as required.  
* **Be Organized and Prepared:** Keep workspaces tidy and ensure all materials and documentation are in order. Prepare adequately for meetings, reviews, and practices to maximize productivity.  
* **Demonstrate Professionalism in Public:** Represent the team with integrity and respect in all external interactions, including competitions, community events, and public forums.  
* **Embrace Constructive Criticism:** View feedback as an opportunity for growth. Be open to suggestions and critiques, and use them to improve your work and the team’s overall performance.  
* **Maintain a High Standard of Workmanship:** Ensure that all tasks are performed to the highest standards of quality. 

### **Additional Categories**

* **Team Dynamics & Communication**  
  * We need to present professionally, and there needs to be communication.  
  * This year is our lock-in year, so if there are any design complaints or ideas they need to be voiced early, and everyone will listen.  
* **Presentation & Branding**  
  * We need to have a professional-looking robot, lights and everything.  
  * We want a consistent theme for the robot, including name, coloring, branding, art.  
* **Inspection & Quality Control**  
  * Create a detailed inspection checklist for each component and subsystem to ensure quality.  
* **Questions for Day 0**  
  * What are the RPs?  
  * What is the Optimal Scoring Cycle?  
  * What is the Optimal Solo Auto?  
  * Do getting the RPs interfere with either Optimal Cycling or the Optimal Auto?
