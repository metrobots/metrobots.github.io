Welcome to the official website of the Metrobots 3324! This repository houses the complete codebase and asset source that powers our teamâ€™s online presence. The website serves as a comprehensive digital platform designed to connect and engage with our diverse audience, including team members, mentors, sponsors, alumni, and the broader community. 
This website was fully created with Github pages, using Codepen.io for quicker prototyping. This is written in what is technically 100% HTML (no CSS or JS), because just to distinguish websites that I've made, I enjoy putting all of the code within the HTML. This means that there are no .js files, and no css styling files, it is all contained within HTML, using <script> & <style> tags. Anyways, have a great time exploring!

All the best,
Mateo Johnson (Metrobots 3324)
