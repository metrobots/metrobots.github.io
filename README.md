Welcome to the official website of FRC team 3324, the Metrobots! This repository houses the complete codebase and asset library that powers our teamâ€™s online presence. This website serves as a comprehensive digital platform designed to connect and engage with our diverse audiences, including team members, mentors, sponsors, alumni, and our broader community.

This website was fully created with GitHub Pages, using Codepen.io for quicker prototyping. I enjoy putting all of the code within the HTML, because it makes my coding mentors upset. This means there are no `.js` (except for one list) or CSS styling files; everything is contained within `<script>` and `<style>` tags. If you find any inconsistencies or have a fun change to implement, feel free to contribute! Have a great time exploring!

All the best,  
Mateo Johnson (Metrobots 3324)
