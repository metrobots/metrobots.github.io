Welcome to the official website of FRC team 3324, the Metrobots! This repository houses the complete codebase and asset library that powers our teamâ€™s online presence. This website serves as a comprehensive digital platform designed to connect and engage with our diverse audiences, including team members, mentors, sponsors, alumni, and our broader community. 
This website was fully created with Github pages, using Codepen.io for quicker prototyping. This is written in what is technically 100% HTML (no CSS or JS), because just to distinguish websites that I've made, I enjoy putting all of the code within the HTML. This means that there are no .js files, and no css styling files, it is all contained within HTML, using <script> & <style> tags. If you find any inconsistencies, or think that you have a fun change to impliment, feel free to contribute! Anyways, have a great time exploring!

All the best,
Mateo Johnson (Metrobots 3324)
